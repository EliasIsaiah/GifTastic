### GifTastic

This is a simple web page that loads a default set of search topics in the form of buttons. Upon clicking each button the query that corresponds with that button is sent to Giphy which then returns via the Giphy API the top ten gifs associated with that query.

Besides the default query options, the user has the option of writing their own query strings and publishing them as buttons that they can then select to see the corresponding gifs.
